Works that should not be openly available online should not be uploaded to Academic Commons.</p>

<h3>How to upload your work</h3>

<h4>Log in to Academic Commons with your Columbia UNI</h4>
<p>If you have a Columbia UNI, you can log in and follow the instructions on how to upload your work. </p>

<h4>If you do not have a Columbia UNI</h4>
<p>Email us at <a href="mailto:ac@columbia.edu">ac@columbia.edu</a>. Tell us about your work and how it meets our guidelines for participation.</p>

<h4>Upload size limits</h4>
<p>You can upload files up to 100MB in size. If you have files larger than 100MB to upload, contact us and we will arrange an alternative method of transfer.</p>

<h4>Fee for files over 10GB</h4>
<p>You can upload individual files up to 10GB free of charge. There is a one-time fee of $5 per GB for individual files that are over 10GB and up to 100GB in size. This fee is payable at the time of upload; contact us for more information. If you have individual files larger than 100GB, please contact us.</p>

<h4>File types</h4>
<p>Our system can support most file types. However, please remember that your work will be more useful to others if you provide it in a format that is either non-proprietary or widely used.</p>

<h3>Your work in the repository</h3>

<h4>Processing uploaded works</h4>
<p>Please allow up to a week for your uploaded works to become available in Academic Commons. Email us <a href="mailto:ac@columbia.edu">ac@columbia.edu</a> if you have any questions or need to request faster processing. If you have a Columbia UNI you will receive an automatic email notification when your work is available in the repository.</p>

<h4>DOI for each work</h4>
<p>Each work in Academic Commons is assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which is a type of persistent URL. A sample DOI is: 10.7916/D8ZS2W8R. DOIs expressed as URLs look like this: https://doi.org/10.7916/D8ZS2W8R. Use the DOI when citing or referring to a work in Academic Commons.</p>

<h4>Usage statistics reports</h4>
<p>Authors who provide a Columbia UNI will receive a monthly email showing the number of downloads for each of their works in Academic Commons. Contact us at <a href="mailto:ac@columbia.edu">ac@columbia.edu</a> if you are not receiving our monthly emails.</p>

<h4>Changing works in the repository</h4>
<p>Because people may be linking to or citing your work, we do not change or replace files that have already been made available in Academic Commons. However we can archive a new version of a work and create a link to its predecessors.</p>

<h4>Removing works from the repository</h4>
<p>We strongly discourage the withdrawal of works from Academic Commons. However, you can request that public access to your work in Academic Commons be disabled. Though the work will no longer be publicly accessible, some metadata about the work will remain.</p>

<h3 id="student-works">Student works in Academic Commons</h3>

<h4>Master’s and undergraduate theses</h4>
<p>Some Master’s and undergraduate programs offer students the option to upload their theses or capstone projects in Academic Commons. Consult your program administrator or faculty advisor for specific program policies.</p>

<h4>Alumni theses</h4>
<p>Graduates of Columbia University and its affiliates can upload their dissertation or thesis in Academic Commons with approval from the degree-granting program. Contact the administrator of your degree program to request permission to upload.</p>

<h4>Thesis embargoes</h4>
<p>If your degree program requires or encourages you to upload your thesis to Academic Commons, you may have the option of placing an embargo on your thesis. An embargo is a limited period of time during which your thesis is not publicly available. During the embargo period, descriptive information about the work is publicly accessible in Academic Commons and in CLIO, the Columbia Libraries catalog, but the thesis itself is not available. Embargo options vary by program and students should consult their degree program’s policies for more information.</p>

<h4>Embargo changes</h4>
<p>If you wish to make changes to the length of the embargo on your thesis in Academic Commons, contact the degree-program administrator with your request. If the request is approved, the program administrator will direct Academic Commons staff to change the embargo release date.</p>

<p><em>Graduates of doctoral programs adminstered by the Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences should submit their request to the Dissertation Office at <a href="mailto:dissertations@columbia.edu">dissertations@columbia.edu</a>.</em></p>

<h4>Embargo changes in ProQuest</h4>
<p>If you also uploaded a thesis to ProQuest you must contact ProQuest directly to request changes to the availability of your work in the ProQuest Dissertation and Theses databases. Contact ProQuest at <a href="mailto:disspub@proquest.com">disspub@proquest.com</a>.</p>

<h4>Other student works</h4>
<p>If you are a student and want to upload other types of research or scholarship  in Academic Commons, you must obtain approval from the appropriate degree program, department, or faculty advisor.  Contact us at <a href="mailto:ac@columbia.edu">ac@columbia.edu</a> to learn more.</p>
